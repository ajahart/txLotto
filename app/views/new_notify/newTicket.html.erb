  <body>Hey my Main Man!  Hope you are doing well.  As soon as you have time, there has been an addition to the scratchoffs and it needs your attention to add the url and tickets made so I can finish my calculations.  I appreciate your heedy response as I still need human companionship from time to time.

    By the way, the ticket that needs to be updated is called <%= name %>.  You can find it in the $<%= price %> section.

    Thank you again,
    The Dude
